Project Title: Car Evaluation Decision Tree Classifier

# Project Title: Decision Tree Classifier for Diabetes Prediction

# Project Description:

The Decision Tree Classifier for Diabetes Prediction is a Python project aimed at utilizing machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for diabetes based on the well-known diabetes dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning repository. This project combines data analysis, machine learning, and performance evaluation to create a robust solution for predicting diabetes status.

# Key Features:

1. Dataset Selection: The project leverages the diabetes dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository. This dataset contains various health-related features, making it suitable for training a decision tree classifier for diabetes prediction.

2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset. Handle missing values, perform feature scaling if necessary, and prepare the data for training.

3. Decision Tree Model Training: Utilize a decision tree classifier to train the model on the diabetes dataset. Decision trees are interpretable and can reveal insights into the factors contributing to diabetes predictions.

4. Performance Measurement: Evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well the model performs in classifying individuals with and without diabetes.

5. Visual Representation of the Decision Tree: Generate a visual representation of the trained decision tree to facilitate interpretability. This visual representation can help stakeholders understand the decision-making process of the model.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning implementation, and Matplotlib for data visualization.
